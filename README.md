# MyTodoList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Add the `--open` or `-o` option to automatically open the browser. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Why Use Angular?

- Create dynamic frontend apps and UIs
- Full featured framework (router, http, etc)
- Intergrated TypeScript (optional)
- RxJS - efficient, async programming
- Test-friendly
- Popular in enterpriser business

## Understanding Angular 

### Components

- Components are pieces of the UI including the template, logic and styling
- They are reusable and can be embedded into the template as an XML-like tag.
- Create component using `ng generate component <component-name>`
- - This command creates the following:
- - A component file `<component-name>.component.ts`
- - A template file `<component-name>.component.html`
- - A CSS file `<component-name>.component.css`
- - A testing spec file `<component-name>.component.spec.ts`

### Services

- Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability
- By seperating a component's view-related functionality from other kinds of processing, you can make your component classes lean and efficient.
- A component can delegate certain tasks to services, such as fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly to the console.

### CLI

- Standard tooling for Angular dev.
- Command line interface for creating apps
- Dev server and easy production build
- Commands to generate components, services, etc

### Templates

### Directives

### Dependency Injection
